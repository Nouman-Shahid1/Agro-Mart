3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Implement your feature or bug fix in your branch. We encourage you to write clean, maintainable code that adheres to our coding standards.

## Code Standards

To maintain a high-quality codebase, please adhere to the following coding standards:

- **Consistency**: Follow the coding conventions used in the project (indentation, naming conventions, etc.).
- **Documentation**: Ensure your code is well-documented. Use comments to explain complex logic and provide clear function/method descriptions.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and ensure existing tests are not broken. We use [insert testing framework] for our tests.

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, we want to hear from you! Here’s how to report an issue:
